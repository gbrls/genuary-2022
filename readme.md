This is a repository for my `genuary 2022` sketches.

`genuary` is an yearly event organized by the generative art community where in
each day of january there'll be a theme and you have to create a piece
following this theme / idea / technique, more info [here](https://genuary.art/).


To run some day's sketch just run `cargo run --bin 09` or any other day instead
of the 9th.
